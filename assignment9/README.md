# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Event Rise
Event Rise is a React-based web application that helps users find event-related job opportunities. This project is built using React and Bootstrap.

Home page with basic information about the website
Jobs page with available job listings
About Us page with information about the website and its creators
Contact Us page with a form to send a message to the website administrators

## Technologies Used
React
Bootstrap
React Router DOM


### React Login Component
This is a React component that implements a basic login functionality using fetch API to communicate with a backend server. It uses React Bootstrap for styling and the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom to navigate to different pages based on the login status.

### Usage
To use this component, import it into your React application and place it where you want the login form to appear.

This component renders a simple login form with two input fields for email and password. When the user clicks on the "Login" button, the component sends an HTTP POST request to the backend server to authenticate the user.

If the authentication is successful, the user is redirected to the home page. Otherwise, an error message is displayed, and the user remains on the login page.

### Dependencies
This component uses the following dependencies:

React
React Bootstrap
useNavigate hook from react-router-dom
Make sure to install them in your application using npm or yarn.

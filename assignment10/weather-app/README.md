This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Weather App
This is a simple React-based web application that fetches and displays weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Weather App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
4. Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up here.
5. Replace the APPID value in the _url variable in the refreshData function in WeatherContainer.js with your API key.
6. Run npm start to start the development server.
7. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage
To use the Weather App, enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Fetch Data" button. The application will fetch weather data for the specified city and display it in a table. The table includes information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather conditions.

The application also includes error handling to handle invalid city names or network errors. If an error occurs, the application will display an error message and clear the table.

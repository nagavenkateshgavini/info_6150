## Project Name: Event Rise

Our tagline is "We organize events. You rise to the occasion." Event Rise is a ticketing platform that focuses on live events, allowing you to discover events that you love and give you a sense of euphoria. We offer a wide range of event categories and our mission is to create a platform that connects people through their passions.

Many people in this world seek a break from their regular work and want to spend time with like-minded individuals in their community. To assist these individuals, we are building a system that allows them to browse live events happening nearby and book tickets for themselves, family, and friends directly from the platform.

In addition to attending events, our platform gives people the opportunity to host events and invite others in their area. This allows individuals to give back to their community and promote a sense of connection.

Our platform also promotes local events, making it easier for organizers to attract an audience without having to go through the hassle and paperwork of traditional methods.

## Working Flow:
The landing page of the platform will feature its primary functions, which include:
- Browsing events
- Receiving event recommendations
- Accessing a list of event categories
- Reading the FAQs

The navigation bar will provide the following buttons:
- Event Categories
- My Events Cart
- Sign In & Sign Up
- Log Out

The "My Events Cart" button will offer multiple functionalities, such as:
- Accessing events in the cart

- Previewing upcoming events

Users will be able to checkout from the platform itself and a digital ticket will be generated upon payment. A payment gateway method will also be linked to the events in the cart.
